    <p>Lala the penguins was a male penguin who was found by a fisher friend of the Hishimoto family in his fishing nets with an injured beak and wing. He kept him on the boat while he was fishing for 3 months before he brought him to the Nishimoto family. They built him a refrigerated room under their house. He accompanied Nishimoto to the fish market daily and eventually began making the trip on his own. A documentry was made about Lala in 1996, as of then Lala was 13 - 14 years old. Sadly now Lala is in the stars, he will forever be in our hearts.</p>

    <p>When the Norwegian King's Guard visited the Edinburgh Military Tattoo (an event) of 1961 for a drill display, a lieutenant named Nils Egelien became interested in adopting a penguin. When the King's Guard returned to Edinburgh in 1972, Egelien arranged for the regiment to adopt a penguin. This penguin was named Nils Olav I in honour of Nils Egelien and King Olav V of Norway. Nils Olav I was given a higher rank in the army of Norway each time they vistied him. In 1987, he was promoted to sergeant. He died shortly after. His place was taken by Nils Olav II. In 2005, Nils Olav II was promoted to colonel-in-chief. In 2008, he was promoted to knighthood, this was such a big honor there even was a ceremony , which hundreds joined. Nills Olav III took over around 2010. On August 22, 2016, he was promoted to brigader. Today, he outranks the person who discovered Antarctica (Nils Egelien).</p>
